# CNN_tucker_decompostion_with_vitisHLS
I.Overview:
  This project showcases a detailed process of designing and optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for hardware deployment. The workflow includes coding the CNN model in Python, converting it to C/C++, and evaluating its performance and efficiency using Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS).
II.Project Workflow:
Step 1: Building the CNN Model
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries Used: TensorFlow or PyTorch
-Description: The CNN model is created and trained in Python, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning frameworks to achieve high accuracy and robustness. This step focuses on defining the model architecture, training it with     suitable datasets, and evaluating its performance.

Step 2: Converting to C/C++
-Purpose: Enable integration with hardware tools and prepare for hardware synthesis.
-Description: Once the CNN model is finalized and performs satisfactorily, it is converted into an equivalent C or C++ implementation. This ensures compatibility with tools like Vitis HLS for hardware optimization.

Step 3: Hardware Optimization with Vitis HLS
-Tool: Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) by Xilinx
-Description: The C/C++ implementation of the CNN model is analyzed using Vitis HLS. This step focuses on optimizing the design for hardware deployment, targeting efficient computational performance, balanced resource utilization, and low power consumption.

III.Key Features:
-Deep Learning Integration: Combines Python-based model training with C/C++ for hardware compatibility.
